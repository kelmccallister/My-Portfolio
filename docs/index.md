I'm Kelsey McCallister, a technical writer and certified CMMI Associate based in New York City. With six years of experience in technical writing, I have developed my skills to encompass Docs-as-Code and writing in adherence to both national and international standards (e.g., FedRAMP, ISO, CMMI). Beyond my professional pursuits, I am passionate about cooking, fitness, and the art of fish keeping. Engaging in these activities is meditative and nourishes my mind as well as my body.

I look forward to connecting with you!
