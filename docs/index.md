# Welcome!

I'm Kelsey McCallister, a Technical Writer and certified CMMI Associate based in New York City. With six years of experience in technical writing and one year as a Quality Management System lead, I have developed my skills to encompass everything from Docs as Code to writing in adherence to both national and international standards (e.g., FedRAMP, ISO, CMMI). My CMMI Associate certification enables my role as an Appraisal Team Member (ATM) on an Executive Quality Review Board (EQRB) for CMMI. In this capacity, I would collaborate with my team to evaluate a company's processes against international best practices, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. 

Feel free to contact me by email at kelsey.mccallister1289@gmail.com or view my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/knmccallister/). I'm always open to networking and new opportunities. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
